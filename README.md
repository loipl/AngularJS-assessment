# Technical Skills Assessment (AngularJS)
Requirements

* Local development environment with Apache web server

Instructions

1. Create a Github account if you don’t have one already
2. Send an email to jason at leadwrench dot com with the subject of “AngularJS Skills Assessment” and include your Github account ID in the body. You will have 1 hour to complete the assessment from the time you send this email.
3. Fork the repository at: https://github.com/loipl/AngularJS-assessment into your account
4. Pull your forked repository into your IDE
5. Fix any JS errors you find. Errors have been intentionally placed in the code. (Do NOT remove 'use strict')
6. Fix any AngularJS error to make sure the "QuizApp" works.
7. Add code to show the result of each question submission near the "Next" button.
   "Correct answer" if the answer is correct, "Wrong answer" if the answer is not correct.
8. Push ALL changes back to your forked repository
9. Create a Pull Request to integrate the fixed code back into the master repository. The Pull Request will ultimately not be merged but will signal your completion of the skills assessment.

Please ask for clarification if you have a question. Guessing an answer to an ambiguous directive will count against you.
